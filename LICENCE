Attribution Notice (Recommended Addition)
You may optionally add this line at the bottom of the LICENSE file to reinforce your IP position:
The Structured Cognition Layer (SCL) specification, including the concepts Jiminy, Actor Scaffold, and Cognition Logger, is licensed under CC BY‑NC‑ND 4.0. Implementations of SCL and all associated modules remain proprietary and are not covered by this license.

This clarifies the conceptual vs. implementation boundary.

If you want, I can also generate the exact README licensing section so your repo communicates this clearly to visitors.
